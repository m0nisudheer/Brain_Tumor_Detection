    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain.</p>
    <p>Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). Brain tumors can begin in your brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain (secondary, or metastatic, brain tumors).</p>
    <p>A typical brain tumor can double in size within just twenty-five days. If the person is not treated correctly, the personâ€™s survival rate is typically less than 12 months.</p>
    <p>Keeping the severity of the problem in mind, a fully automated method for detecting brain tumors is required.</p>
